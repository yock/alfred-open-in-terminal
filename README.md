Open Finder Folder in Terminal
==============================

A workflow for [Alfred][alfred].
--------------------------------

OSX Finder provides many beautiful folder browsing options for Mac users, but lacks
a convenient way to launch your favorite terminal app at your current location.
This workflow provides an easy for Alfred users to open a command prompt at their
current location.

This workflow borrows ideas and some code from [Open folder in iTerm2][sbilde]
